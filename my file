"My uncle has the most honest rules,
When not in the joke was sick,
He made himself respected
I couldn't think of a better one.
His example to others is science;
But, my God, what a bore
Sit with the patient day and night,
Without moving a step away!
What low cunning
Amuse the half-dead,
He needs to fix his pillows,
It is sad to bring medicine,
Sigh and think to yourself:
When the devil will take you!"
Thought the young rake,
Flying in the dust at the post office,
By the Supreme will of Zeves
The heir of all his relatives.
Friends of Lyudmila and Ruslan!
With the hero of my novel
Without Preface, this very hour
Let me introduce you:
Onegin, my good friend,
Born on the banks of the Neva river,
Where, perhaps, were you born
Or shone, my reader;
I used to walk there too:
But the North is bad for me one.
Having served well nobly,
His father lived in debt,
Gave three balls annually
And was hanging about at last.
The fate of Eugene kept:
first Madame followed him,
Then Monsieur changed it.
The child was sharp, but sweet.
Monsieur l'abb√©, a poor Frenchman,
So that the child is not exhausted,
Taught him everything in jest,
Not bothered by strict morals,
Slightly scolded for pranks
And he took me for a walk in The summer garden.
When is youth rebellious
It's time for Eugene,
It's time for hopes and tender sadness,
Monsieur was chased out of the courtyard.
Here is my Onegin at large;
Cut in the latest fashion,
2 as the dandy London is dressed -
And finally saw the light.
He speaks French perfectly.
He could speak and write;
Easily Mazurka danced
And bowed easily;
What do you want more? Light decided,
That he's smart and very nice.
We all learned a little
something and somehow,
So education, thank God,
We have no wonder to Shine.
Onegin was in the opinion of many
(Resolute and strict judges)
A learned fellow, but a pedant:
He had a happy talent
Without compulsion in conversation
Touch everything lightly,
With the scholarly air of a connoisseur
Remain silent in an important dispute
And make the ladies smile
The fire of unexpected epigrams.
Latin is out of fashion now:
So, if I tell you the truth,
He knew quite a bit of Latin,
That the epigraphs to assort,
To talk about Juvenal,
Put vale at the end of the email,
Yes, I remembered, though not without sin,
two verses from the Aeneid.
He didn't want to rummage
In the chronological dust
Chronicles of the land:
But days of past jokes
From Romulus to the present day
He kept it in his memory.
High passion without having
For the sounds of life do not spare,
He could not iambic from trochaic,
No matter how hard we fight, we can tell the difference.
He Scolded Homer, Of Theocritus;
But I read Adam Smith
And was a deep economy,
That is, he was able to judge,
How the state gets rich,
And what lives, and why
He doesn't need gold,
When a simple product has.
My father couldn't understand it
And he gave the land as collateral.
Everything else Eugene knew,
Tell me about the lack of time;
But what was his true genius,
What did he know better than all the Sciences,
That was for him smlad
And labor, and flour, and joy,
What took the whole day
His yearning laziness, -
Was the science of tender passion,
Which Nazon sang,
For which he ended up a Sufferer
Its age is brilliant and rebellious
In Moldova, in the wilderness of the steppes,
Far from his own Italy.
