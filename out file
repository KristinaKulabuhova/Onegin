He could not iambic from trochaic,
Amuse the half-dead,
That was for him smlad
Easily Mazurka danced
What do you want more? Light decided,
2 as the dandy London is dressed -
He made himself respected
So that the child is not exhausted,
two verses from the Aeneid.
He doesn't need gold,
Chronicles of the land:
Onegin, my good friend,
So education, thank God,
Monsieur was chased out of the courtyard.
Flying in the dust at the post office,
That he's smart and very nice.
His example to others is science;
No matter how hard we fight, we can tell the difference.
He didn't want to rummage
That is, he was able to judge,
Here is my Onegin at large;
Thought the young rake,
And make the ladies smile
We all learned a little
Tell me about the lack of time;
It's time for Eugene,
It is sad to bring medicine,
We have no wonder to Shine.
But the North is bad for me one.
I couldn't think of a better one.
For the sounds of life do not spare,
But, my God, what a bore
He could speak and write;
Remain silent in an important dispute
Sigh and think to yourself:
Which Nazon sang,
What low cunning
High passion without having
How the state gets rich,
But I read Adam Smith
So, if I tell you the truth,
When not in the joke was sick,
To talk about Juvenal,
And he gave the land as collateral.
With the hero of my novel
Put vale at the end of the email,
first Madame followed him,
Friends of Lyudmila and Ruslan!
Monsieur l'abb√©, a poor Frenchman,
And he took me for a walk in The summer garden.
Yes, I remembered, though not without sin,
He knew quite a bit of Latin,
Cut in the latest fashion,
Was the science of tender passion,
Without compulsion in conversation
Where, perhaps, were you born
I used to walk there too:
Or shone, my reader;
For which he ended up a Sufferer
Born on the banks of the Neva river,
With the scholarly air of a connoisseur
Without Preface, this very hour
When a simple product has.
What did he know better than all the Sciences,
(Resolute and strict judges)
But days of past jokes
"My uncle has the most honest rules,
In Moldova, in the wilderness of the steppes,
By the Supreme will of Zeves
The heir of all his relatives.
Slightly scolded for pranks
Not bothered by strict morals,
The fire of unexpected epigrams.
It's time for hopes and tender sadness,
His yearning laziness, -
But what was his true genius,
Its age is brilliant and rebellious
When is youth rebellious
He Scolded Homer, Of Theocritus;
He needs to fix his pillows,
His father lived in debt,
The child was sharp, but sweet.
And finally saw the light.
Sit with the patient day and night,
Then Monsieur changed it.
My father couldn't understand it
A learned fellow, but a pedant:
He had a happy talent
The fate of Eugene kept:
That the epigraphs to assort,
And was hanging about at last.
Taught him everything in jest,
In the chronological dust
Let me introduce you:
When the devil will take you!"
Everything else Eugene knew,
something and somehow,
Latin is out of fashion now:
What took the whole day
From Romulus to the present day
Without moving a step away!
And what lives, and why
Having served well nobly,
And bowed easily;
Gave three balls annually
He speaks French perfectly.
Touch everything lightly,
And was a deep economy,
Onegin was in the opinion of many
And labor, and flour, and joy,
He kept it in his memory.
Far from his own Italy.
