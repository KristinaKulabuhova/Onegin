of entertaining the half-dead:
one smoothes the pillows down in bed,
Let others learn from his example!
But God, how deadly dull to sample
And the sly baseness, fit to throttle,
and glumly serves the medicine bottle,
and sighs, and asks oneself all through:
but when past joking he fell sick,
and never played a shrewder trick.
«My uncle — high ideals inspire him;
he really forced one to admire him -
sickroom attendance night and day
and never stir a foot away!
«When will the devil come for you?»»
