But the North is bad for me one.
I couldn't think of a better one.
To talk about Juvenal,
And he gave the land as collateral.


Which Nazon sang,
What low cunning
Chronicles of the land:
Onegin, my good friend,


And finally saw the light.
Sit with the patient day and night,
For which he ended up a Sufferer
Born on the banks of the Neva river,


Yes, I remembered, though not without sin,
He knew quite a bit of Latin,
Taught him everything in jest,
In the chronological dust


It's time for hopes and tender sadness,
His yearning laziness, -
Gave three balls annually
He speaks French perfectly.


He could speak and write;
Remain silent in an important dispute
And make the ladies smile
We all learned a little


From Romulus to the present day
Without moving a step away!
"My uncle has the most honest rules,
In Moldova, in the wilderness of the steppes,


(Resolute and strict judges)
But days of past jokes
Friends of Lyudmila and Ruslan!
Monsieur l'abb√©, a poor Frenchman,


Was the science of tender passion,
Without compulsion in conversation
Its age is brilliant and rebellious
When is youth rebellious


Cut in the latest fashion,
Was the science of tender passion,
What low cunning
High passion without having


A learned fellow, but a pedant:
He had a happy talent
Then Monsieur changed it.
My father couldn't understand it


What did he know better than all the Sciences,
(Resolute and strict judges)
something and somehow,
Latin is out of fashion now:


His example to others is science;
No matter how hard we fight, we can tell the difference.
Let me introduce you:
When the devil will take you!"


2 as the dandy London is dressed -
He made himself respected
Amuse the half-dead,
That was for him smlad


It is sad to bring medicine,
We have no wonder to Shine.
He speaks French perfectly.
Touch everything lightly,


Or shone, my reader;
For which he ended up a Sufferer
He made himself respected
So that the child is not exhausted,


But what was his true genius,
Its age is brilliant and rebellious
When is youth rebellious
He Scolded Homer, Of Theocritus;


Having served well nobly,
And bowed easily;
With the scholarly air of a connoisseur
Without Preface, this very hour


Flying in the dust at the post office,
That he's smart and very nice.
That is, he was able to judge,
Here is my Onegin at large;


It's time for Eugene,
It is sad to bring medicine,
And was hanging about at last.
Taught him everything in jest,
