and never played a shrewder trick.
but when past joking he fell sick,
of entertaining the half - dead:
one smoothes the pillows down in bed,


he really forced one to admire him -
"My uncle - high ideals inspire him;
and glumly serves the medicine bottle,
And the sly baseness, fit to throttle,


sickroom attendance night and day
and never stir a foot away!
But God, how deadly dull to sample
Let others learn from his example!
